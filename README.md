audiopractice
=============

Demo repo for new members to the Audio Team to practice GIT concepts.
Please note that this repo is unrelated to the Linux-based repos used in daily work.
The biggest challenge to getting a clone repo populated was getting the SSH key set up.

Adding a 4th comment to test how to update a local repo when the master/origin is updated directly.
